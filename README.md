# EXO
EXO is a skeleton framework currently beign built to simplify web site layout. 

The goal of this framework is to render the task of converting layouts that use absolute sizing methods to relative sized grid layout (px to %) by wrapping pages in a global wrapper, overwriting only specific style attributes and applying inherited styles to all child objects.

The framework will also simplify the creation of mobile specific objects such as gutters, panel layout, icon navigation, buttons, gestures and common breakpoints. 

The javascript component of the exo project will make it easier to manipulate the dom by targeting object attributes recursively.

Any collaboration on this project would be greatly appreciated.

```See /exo/skeleton/sass for latest core css.
