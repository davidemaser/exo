# EXO
EXO is a skeleton framework currently beign built to simplify web site layout. 

The goal of this framework is to render the task of converting layouts that use absolute sizing methods to relative sized grid layout (px to %).   

The javascript component of the exo project will make it easier to manipulate the dom by targeting object attributes recursively.
